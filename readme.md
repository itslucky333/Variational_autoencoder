# Variational Autoencoder for Image Data

## Overview
This project implements a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for generating and reconstructing images using deep learning techniques. The model is designed to learn a latent representation of input images and can be used for tasks such as image denoising, inpainting, or generating new images similar to the training data.
